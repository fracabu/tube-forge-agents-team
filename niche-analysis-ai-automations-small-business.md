## 6. RISKS & MITIGATION STRATEGIES

### Risk Assessment:

**1. YouTube AI Policy Changes (Medium Risk)**
- YouTube updated policies in July 2025 restricting purely AI-generated content
- Risk: Demonetization if content appears AI-generated

**Mitigation:**
- Always appear on camera (at least in intro/outro)
- Original voiceover (not AI voice)
- Personal commentary and analysis
- Show real implementation, not just AI-generated examples

**2. Market Saturation (Low-Medium Risk)**
- More creators entering AI education space
- Risk: Increased competition for viewer attention

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on underserved Italian market first
- Industry-specific vertical content (harder to replicate)
- Build community/moat through templates and support
- Establish authority early through consulting proof

**3. Rapid Tool Changes (High Risk)**
- AI tools evolve quickly, content becomes outdated
- Risk: Evergreen content shelf-life reduced

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on workflows/principles, not just tools
- Create "tool-agnostic" foundation content
- Quarterly update videos for popular topics
- Build email list for update notifications

**4. Small Business Budget Constraints (Medium Risk)**
- Economic downturn could reduce spending on AI tools/courses
- Risk: Lower affiliate commissions and course sales

**Mitigation:**
- Always include free/low-cost alternatives
- Focus on cost-saving automations (recession-proof)
- Offer payment plans for courses
- Diversify revenue (not dependent on one stream)

**5. Technical Complexity Barrier (Medium Risk)**
- Audience may still find content too complex
- Risk: High bounce rate, low implementation rate

**Mitigation:**
- Over-explain every step (assume zero knowledge)
- Offer "done-for-you" templates
- Create support community for questions
- Provide troubleshooting videos for common errors
