## INTRO SCENE (0:00 - 0:10)

### PROMPT 1: Opening Hook - The Overwhelmed Entrepreneur

**Scene Description:**
```
Cinematic establishing shot of a small Italian business office. A middle-aged entrepreneur sits at a cluttered desk, surrounded by stacks of papers, multiple monitors showing email inboxes with hundreds of unread messages, a smartphone buzzing with WhatsApp notifications. Morning light streams through venetian blinds creating dramatic shadows. The person rubs their temples in visible frustration.

Camera movement: Slow dolly-in from wide shot to medium close-up on the desk chaos.

Style: Realistic, warm color palette with orange and amber tones, slight film grain, shallow depth of field focusing on the overwhelmed expression.

Lighting: Natural morning sunlight from window left, soft fill from monitor screens.

Duration: 5 seconds
```

**Negative prompt:** cartoon, anime, oversaturated, artificial lighting, empty desk, happy expression, corporate office

---

### PROMPT 2: Transformation Moment - AI Activation

**Scene Description:**
```
The same office scene undergoes a magical transformation. Digital particles and soft blue light emanate from the computer screen, flowing across the desk. Papers organize themselves, email notifications clear away in a cascade effect, the phone stops buzzing. The entrepreneur's expression shifts from stressed to relieved, almost amazed.

Camera movement: Static medium shot with subtle zoom-in as the transformation happens.

Style: Blend of realistic and subtle sci-fi elements. The digital effects should feel organic, not harsh. Think soft particle systems, gentle glows, not aggressive CGI.

Lighting: Transition from warm morning light to a balanced warm-cool mix as the blue digital elements appear.

Visual metaphor: Chaos becoming order through invisible digital assistance.

Duration: 5 seconds
```

**Negative prompt:** harsh neon, cyberpunk aesthetic, robots, mechanical elements, completely dark room

## B-ROLL SCENES FOR AUTOMATION SECTIONS

### PROMPT 3: Email Automation - The Infinite Inbox

**Scene Description:**
```
Close-up of a laptop screen showing an email inbox. Camera positioned over-the-shoulder of an unseen user. Emails are visibly arriving, but instead of accumulating, they automatically sort themselves. Some emails glow briefly with a soft green outline and a "draft reply" icon appears next to them. The effect suggests intelligent processing without being overtly sci-fi.

Camera movement: Slight handheld movement for realism, gentle push-in toward the screen.

Style: Realistic office environment, screen content should look like actual Gmail interface. Natural lighting from an office window.

Key visual: Focus on the satisfying moment when an email is "handled" - perhaps a subtle checkmark animation or the email smoothly sliding to a "processed" folder.

Duration: 4 seconds
```

**Negative prompt:** futuristic interfaces, holographic displays, dark hacker aesthetic

---

### PROMPT 4: Invoice Automation - Money Flow Visualization

**Scene Description:**
```
Abstract but grounded visualization of automated invoicing. A calendar page showing "1st of the month" transitions smoothly. Digital invoice documents generate and fly outward like paper airplanes toward floating icons representing different clients/businesses. Each invoice that "lands" triggers a small shower of euro coins flowing back.

Camera movement: Smooth lateral tracking shot following the invoice flow.

Style: Clean, modern motion graphics aesthetic but with realistic textures. Invoices should look like actual Italian "fattura elettronica" documents. Background is a soft, professional blue gradient.

Visual metaphor: The automation of recurring revenue and the reliability of cash flow.

Duration: 5 seconds
```

**Negative prompt:** cryptocurrency symbols, dollar signs, gambling imagery, overly complex visuals

---

### PROMPT 5: Social Media - Content Calendar Magic

**Scene Description:**
```
A smartphone and laptop on a stylish desk, both showing social media interfaces. Above them, floating content cards (Instagram posts, Facebook updates, LinkedIn articles) arrange themselves into a weekly calendar grid. Each card briefly glows as it "locks into" its scheduled time slot. Small icons representing different platforms (Instagram camera, Facebook 'f', LinkedIn 'in') appear next to each piece of content.

Camera movement: Top-down bird's eye view, slowly rotating 15 degrees during the shot.

Style: Clean, aspirational lifestyle aesthetic. Think modern influencer workspace - white desk, plant, coffee cup. Soft natural lighting.

Key visual: The satisfying moment of organization - scattered content becoming a structured plan.

Duration: 4 seconds
```

**Negative prompt:** messy room, old technology, dark environment, corporate sterility

---

### PROMPT 6: Meeting Transcription - Words Becoming Text

**Scene Description:**
```
Split-screen composition. Left side: A video conference call with four participants in separate windows, visibly speaking and gesturing. Right side: A document that automatically populates with text as the conversation happens. Visual "sound waves" travel from the video call side to the document side, transforming into written words upon arrival.

Camera movement: Static composition with dynamic internal movement (the soundwave flow).

Style: Professional and clean. Video call participants should look like typical Italian small business people - not corporate suits, but not too casual either. The document side should resemble Notion or Google Docs.

Visual metaphor: Voice becoming permanent, searchable record without manual effort.

Duration: 5 seconds
```

**Negative prompt:** surveillance imagery, futuristic holograms, single person alone

---

### PROMPT 7: WhatsApp Chatbot - 24/7 Customer Service

**Scene Description:**
```
Night scene transitioning to day. A smartphone showing WhatsApp Business interface is positioned on a nightstand. The phone screen shows incoming messages and automatic replies being sent, indicated by the typical WhatsApp blue checkmarks. Through a window behind the phone, we see a time-lapse of the moon setting and sun rising, while the phone continues its automated conversations.

Camera movement: Gentle arc around the phone, capturing both the device and the window time-lapse.

Style: Cozy bedroom/home office environment. Warm lamplight on the nightstand, cool moonlight/daylight from window. The phone screen should be the brightest element.

Visual metaphor: Your business working while you rest.

Duration: 5 seconds
```

**Negative prompt:** call center, robot characters, cold corporate environment

---

## OUTRO SCENE

### PROMPT 8: The Liberated Entrepreneur - Time Reclaimed

**Scene Description:**
```
The same entrepreneur from the opening scene, but now in a completely different context. They're outside a small Italian cafe, enjoying a coffee and reading a book (or playing with children, or walking a dog - lifestyle choice). Their smartphone briefly lights up with a notification, they glance at it, smile knowing everything is handled, and return to their activity.

Camera movement: Medium shot, slight handheld movement for documentary feel, natural rack focus from phone to person's face.

Style: Bright, optimistic Italian lifestyle. Mediterranean colors - terracotta, olive green, sky blue. Golden hour lighting.

Visual metaphor: Technology enabling life, not consuming it. The goal of automation: more time for what matters.

Duration: 6 seconds
```

**Negative prompt:** stressed expression, indoor office, rainy weather, isolation

## THUMBNAIL GENERATION PROMPTS

### Thumbnail Option A: Before/After Split

```
Split image composition. Left half: Stressed Italian entrepreneur drowning in paperwork, red/orange angry tones, cluttered desk, clock showing late hour. Right half: Same person but relaxed, smiling, clean desk with single laptop, blue/green calm tones, window showing sunny day. A bold diagonal line separates the two halves. Large "10 ORE" text would be added in post.

Style: High contrast, slightly exaggerated expressions for YouTube click appeal while remaining professional. Photo-realistic but with enhanced colors.

Composition: Person's face visible in both halves, direct eye contact with camera.
```

### Thumbnail Option B: Robot Assistant

```
Close-up of hands typing on a laptop, but the laptop screen shows multiple tasks being completed by floating AI assistant icons (friendly, simple robot face or sparkle/magic wand). Euro symbols and clock icons float around suggesting money and time saved. Warm office lighting.

Style: Realistic hands and laptop, stylized but not cartoonish floating elements. Clean and professional.

Composition: Hands in lower third, laptop screen in middle, floating elements in upper area.
```

### Thumbnail Option C: Time Transformation

```
Creative hourglass concept. The top of the hourglass contains icons of tedious tasks (emails, invoices, social posts). The sand falling through is golden/glowing. The bottom fills with euro coins and happy life moments (family, vacation, hobby icons). Background is professional dark blue gradient.

Style: Clean infographic aesthetic with depth and dimension. Not flat design but not hyper-realistic.

Composition: Centered hourglass, large enough to clearly see the iconography inside.
```
